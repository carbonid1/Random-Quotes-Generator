    "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water or do you want a chance to change the world?",
    "It's more fun to be a pirate than to join the Navy.",
    "Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter to me … Going to bed at night saying we've done something wonderful... that's what matters to me.",
    "When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.",
    "I'm convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance.",
    "When you're young, you look at television and think, There's a conspiracy. The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But when you get a little older, you realize that's not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want. That's a far more depressing thought. Conspiracy is optimistic! You can shoot the bastards! We can have a revolution! But the networks are really in business to give people what they want. It's the truth.",
    "Creativity is just connecting things.",
    "We have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.",
    "I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what's next.",
    "Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.",
    "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path and that will make all the difference.",
    "You always have to keep pushing to innovate. Dylan could have sung protest songs forever and probably made a lot of money, but he didn’t. He had to move on, and when he did, by going electric in 1965, he alienated a lot of people. His 1966 Europe tour was his greatest…. The Beatles were the same way. They kept evolving, moving, refining their art. That’s what I’ve always tried to do — keep moving. Otherwise, as Dylan says, if you are not busy being born, you’re busy dying.",

    "The better part of one's life consists of his friendships.",
    "Those who deny freedom to others, deserve it not for themselves; and, under a just God, can not long retain it.",
    "Free labor has the inspiration of hope; pure slavery has no hope.",
    "I believe each individual is naturally entitled to do as he pleases with himself and the fruit of his labor, so far as it in no wise interferes with any other man's rights.",
    "A capacity, and taste, for reading, gives access to whatever has already been discovered by others. It is the key, or one of the keys, to the already solved problems. And not only so. It gives a relish, and facility, for successfully pursuing the [yet] unsolved ones.",
    "I don't believe in a law to prevent a man from getting rich; it would do more harm than good. So while we do not propose any war upon capital, we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else. When one starts poor, as most do in the race of life, free society is such that he knows he can better his condition; he knows that there is no fixed condition of labor, for his whole life.",

    "All types of knowledge, ultimately mean self knowledge.",
    "Boards don't hit back.",
    "There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level.",
    "Don't get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water. Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.",
    "Do not deny the classical approach, simply as a reaction, or you will have created another pattern and trapped yourself there.",
    "Running water never grows stale. So you just have to 'keep on flowing.'",
    "Walk on.",

    "It is precisely facts that do not exist, only interpretations.",
    "Art is the supreme task and the truly metaphysical activity in this life...",
    "Underneath this reality in which we live and have our being, another and altogether different reality lies concealed...",
    "What does man actually know about himself?",
    "Where there have been powerful governments, societies, religions, public opinions, in short wherever there has been tyranny, there the solitary philosopher has been hated; for philosophy offers an asylum to a man into which no tyranny can force it way, the inward cave, the labyrinth of the heart.",
    "The secret for harvesting from existence the greatest fruitfulness and greatest enjoyment is — to live dangerously.",
    "I would not know what the spirit of a philosopher might wish more to be than a good dancer.",
    "If a temple is to be erected, a temple must be destroyed.",

    "Victory attained by violence is tantamount to a defeat, for it is momentary.",
    "The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.",
    "One of the objects of a newspaper is to understand popular feeling and to give expression to it; another is to arouse among the people certain desirable sentiments; and the third is fearlessly to expose popular defects.",
    "Under democracy individual liberty of opinion and action is jealously guarded.",
    "Any action that is dictated by fear or by coercion of any kind ceases to be moral.",

    "Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.",
    "In the Chinese language, the word 'crisis' is composed of two characters, one representing danger and the other, opportunity.",
    "Although a country may stand still, history never stands still. Thus, if we do not soon begin to move forward again, we will inevitably be left behind. … But effort and courage are not enough without purpose and direction. For, as Socrates told us, 'If a man does not know to what port he is sailing, no wind is favorable.'",
    "Things don't just happen, they are made to happen.",
    "The world was not meant to be a prison in which man awaits his execution.",
